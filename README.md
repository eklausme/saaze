# Simplified Saaze

_Simplified Saaze_ is a fast, all-inclusive, flat-file CMS for simple websites and blogs. It's not designed to be a replacement for great CMS's (e.g. WordPress, Statamic etc.), rather it's designed to be a smaller, simpler alternative.

Static site builders are fast but normally have a steep learning curve and require lots of tooling to make them work. We believe building a personal site should be stupidly simple. That's why _Simplified Saaze_ is built on the following principles.

* Easy to run - All you need is PHP8, a C compiler, and Composer
* Easy to host - Serve dynamically or statically
* Easy to edit - Edit content using simple Markdown files
* Easy to theme - Templates use plain PHP/HTML
* Fast and secure - No database = less moving parts + more speed
* Simple to understand - Everything is a collection of entries
